#Stock Price Prediction Using Long-Short-Term-Memory
This project seeks to utilize Deep Learning models, LongShort Term Memory (LS TM) Neural  Network algorithm to predict stock prices.  We will use Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using historical closing price and trading  volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time a nd the optimal parameters for  the model.
